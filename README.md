### 1. Python

**Project Title: Crude Oil Forecasting** [See the Project Here](https://github.com/ruhularahi/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Crude_Oil_Production_Forecasting.ipynb)\
**Project Details:** The goal of the project was to build a time series forecasting model using AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models<br/>to forecast oil production. The dataset consisted of time series data on US oil production from 1992 to 2018.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets, with data from 1992 to 2012 used for training while the remaining years used for testing. 
- Checked for stationarity in the data by looking for seasonality, heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation. Used differencing methods to make the dataset stationary. 
- Built AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA models and found that the ARIMA (2,3,2) model gave the best results.

**Project Title: Sales Prediction of a Retail Company** [See the Project Here](https://github.com/ruhularahi/Portfolio_Projects_DS/blob/main/BigMart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb)\
**Project Details:** The goal of the project was to identify significant features that impacted the company’s product sales by 10% in the last year.
- Cleaned and tabulated large, structured data sets with over a hundred thousand records and performed exploratory data analysis and data processing to gain insights into key aspects of the data and features. 
- Checked for and addressed outliers, duplicates, and missing values while also checking for multicollinearity and other assumptions of the multivariate regression model. 
- Successfully predicted the model with a good fit and a cross-validation score that was similar to the R-Square value.

### 2. SQL

**Project Title: Getting Insights for a Japanese Restaurant named "Danny's Dinner"** [See the Project Here](https://github.com/ruhularahi/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Danny's%20Dinner.sql)\
**Project Details:** Danny collected some data from it's day to operations and wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
- Created the schema for three differnt tables.
- Provide query necessary to get the insights from the data, for instance "If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?"

### 3. Tableau
