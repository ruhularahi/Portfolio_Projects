##### Patient Survival Prediction

The project objective was to getting insights from the patient database on death and survival numbers. <br>
For instance, I calculated the following measures to provide insights relating to the patient database.
- mortality rate
- death count by gender and ethnicity
- death and survival rate of patients by age groups
- ICU admission source for most deaths
- patients suffering from each comorbidity and death number from each comorbidity

The dataset [Patient Survival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitishaagarwal/patient/data) is taken from kaggle.
