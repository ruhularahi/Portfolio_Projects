# IMDB Dataset Analysis with Power BI

#### Overview

This project is an exploratory data analysis of the IMDB dataset found on data.world. Using Power BI, I have created an interactive dashboard that provides insights into movies, genres, directors, and box office performance, focusing on trends across years. The main goal of this project was to visualize key metrics that could help users easily understand the performance of movies and the characteristics that drive box office success and high ratings.

#### Dataset

The dataset consists of top 250 IMDB movies and around 5000 additional movie records. It includes fields like movie title, director, year, genre, box office sales, runtime, IMDB rating, and other relevant metrics.
